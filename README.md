# web_scrapping_and_designing_custom_courses

Data science continues to evolve as one of the most promising and in-demand career paths for skilled professionals. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. The objective of this project is to design a master's program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence which will not only include technical aspects but also poses business-oriented skills. The aim is to acquire relevant data by web-scraping and performing analysis to gain insights and make appropriate data-driven decisions. The project will also propose changes in the current curriculum based on the performed analysis. The project will lastly address the job search part through educational efforts in data science.
